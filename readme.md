## Final Projects from Penn Design: MUSA611 // CPLN692, Spring 2019
#### Introduction to Web Mapping

Students spent the final portion of the semester working on the final project on the subject of their choice.    
    
About half the students entered the class with some programming experience. A couple of students had fairly significant experience. But just about everyone was new to JavaScript + Web mapping tools and enrolled in the class out of an interest to learn more about open source tools for making online, interactive maps and other data visualization tools.     
    
We are including the final projects here out of the believe that students in future classes may be able to partner with groups interested in incorporating a map into a real world project.   The following projects were all developed by individuals or groups of 2-3 students working together for 3 - 6 weeks.
